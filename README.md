# probe.rs

## Development

The entire webpage is built with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) which is based on statically compiled Markdown and [tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) templates.
You can run the file watcher & compiler with `zola serve` during development. The webpage will automatically be reloaded every time you change any involved file.

Currently, zola version 0.14 or higher is used.

You can install the latest build of zola by running `cargo install --git https://github.com/getzola/zola`.  You will need the runtime and development packages for libsass installed on your OS.

## Deployment

To deploy the webpage we use Docker.
The container can be built with `scripts/build_docker.sh` and run locally with `scripts/run_docker.sh`.
To deploy the container for the `probe.rs` domain, please contact @Yatekii or @tiwalun.
