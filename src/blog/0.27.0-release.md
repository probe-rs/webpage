Guess whoâ€™s ðŸ”™!

After a long break from blogging, we are back with some fresh updates.

First of all, a massive thank you to those who filled our [probe-rs feedback survey](https://forms.gle/FRtUwuFCCKgKKy7d7) - we got a lot of good ideas for our roadmap! You can also still fill out the survey if you havenâ€™t had a chance.

Secondly, we just released probe-rs 0.27 with the long awaited support for the **RP2035**. Go and have fun with it (and don't forget to [report bugs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs)!) :)

Stay tuned for bigger news soon!
