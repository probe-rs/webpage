  **probe-rs** ships many in-built targets.

  If a target is not listed,
  you have the option to <a href="http://localhost:3000/docs/knowledge-base/cmsis-packs/#target-extraction">extract it from CMSIS-Pack</a> or if that
  does not exist either, <a href="https://github.com/probe-rs/flash-algorithm-template">write a flash algorithm</a> form scratch with our templates.
