# Quickly

```

## Windows (PowerShell)

# Installing from source (`cargo install`)

## Prerequisites

To build probe-rs from source, you will need a working Rust toolchain. The easiest way is to follow the [rustup installation instructions](https://rustup.rs).

### Debian-based Linux

On Debian and derived distros (e.g. Ubuntu), the following packages need to be installed:

```bash
sudo apt install -y pkg-config libudev-dev
```

### RPM-based Linux (Fedora, CentOS)

```bash
dnf install libusbx-devel libudev-devel
```

### macOS, Windows

No additional setup is required.

## Installation

Install with `cargo install`. This will install the `probe-rs`, `cargo-flash` and `cargo-embed` binaries and put them in `$PATH`.

```bash
cargo install probe-rs --features cli
```
